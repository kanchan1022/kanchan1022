👋 Hey there, fellow coding enthusiasts! I'm Kanchan Pande, a third-year computer science student at KJ College of Engineering in Pune, riding the coding rollercoaster!

💻 Dive into my digital realm and explore the cool projects I've conjured up:

Calculator Magic 🧮: Beyond basic math, my calculator project is a playground for number wizards. Let's make numbers dance!

Portfolio Wonderland 🌐: Take a stroll through my online portfolio - a whimsical garden of skills, projects, and triumphs. It's not just a website; it's a journey!

Landing Page Blastoff 🚀: Buckle up for a landing page experience that's not just a stopover; it's a launchpad to exciting content. Fasten your seatbelts!

College Inquiry Chat Bot 🤖: Meet my chat bot buddy! It's not your typical bot; it's your virtual college tour guide. Ask away, future scholars!
